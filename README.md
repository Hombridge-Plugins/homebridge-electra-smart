| `disableFan`               |  When set to `true`, it will disable the FAN accessory        |          |  `false` |  Boolean |
| `disableDry`               |  When set to `true`, it will disable the DRY accessory       |          |  `false` |  Boolean |
| `statePollingInterval`          | Time in seconds between each status polling of the Electra devices (set to 0 for no polling)     |  `90` |  Integer |
| `swingDirection`               |  Choose what kind of swing you would like to control in HomeKit. can be `"vertical"`, `"horizontal"` or `"both"`        |          |  `"both"` |  Boolean |
| `minTemperature`               |  Minimum Temperature to show in HomeKit Control         |          |  `16` |  Integer |
| `maxTemperature`               |  Maximum Temperature to show in HomeKit Control        |          |  `30` |  Integer |

### Fan speeds & "AUTO" speed
Since HomeKit control over fan speed is with a slider between 0-100, the plugin converts the steps you have in the Electra app to values between 1 to 100, when 100 is highest and 1 is lowest. Setting the fan speed to 0, should actually set it to "AUTO" speed.

*Available fan speeds: AUTO, LOW, MED, HIGH*

### Swing
Swing support is added automatically if supported.
Since HomeKit only have one control for swing, you can choose which swing type you would like HomeKit to control: vertical, horizontal or both (default).

### Issues & Debug

#### I can't control the device, it always goes to previous state

Check the internet connection and that you can control the device from Electra Smart app.
If that doesn't help, turn on debug logs in the plugin settings and look for errors.

#### Log error shows "intruder lockout"

Electra detected that the plugin is spamming the api and consider it as intruder.
To fix this issue immediately you can refresh the token and imei by deleting them in the config UI and clicking on the button to fetch them back.
You can potentially prevent this error by setting polling interval to a very high number or 0.

#### others

If you experience any issues with the plugins please refer to the [Issues](https://github.com/nitaybz/homebridge-electra-smart/issues) tab or [electra-smart Discord channel](https://discord.gg/ZX3wSZpXaP) and check if your issue is already described there, if it doesn't, please create a new issue with as much detailed information as you can give (logs are crucial).<br>

if you want to even speed up the process, you can add `"debug": true` to your config, which will give me more details on the logs and speed up fixing the issue.
